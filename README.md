# HTML & CSS Projects Workspace

This repository contains a collection of small web-based projects, each organized in its own folder.

## Current Projects

- [Profile Card](./profile-card/README.md): A modern and attractive profile card with social media links and user stats.

## How This Repository is Organized

- Each project is contained within its own directory (e.g., `profile-card`).
- Each project directory contains its own code and a dedicated `README.md` describing its features and usage.

## Adding New Projects

- Create a new folder for your project at the root level (e.g., `new-project-folder`).
- Add your project files and a `README.md` explaining that specific project.
- Update this root `README.md` with a brief description and link to the new project.
